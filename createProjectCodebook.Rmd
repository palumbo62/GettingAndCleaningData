# Human-Activity-Recognition-Using-Smartphones Project Codebook

This codebook provides detailed information with respect to 
the tidy dataset output generated by running 'run_analysis.r'.
It is autogenerated at the end of each successful execution
of the script.

Codebook Creation:  `r as.character(Sys.time())`


## Tidy Dataset Variable Names
Variable Name    | Description
-----------------|------------
SubjectID        | Numeric identifier of each test subject responsible for performing each observation sample. 
ActivityID       | Descriptive name of each performed/sampled activity. 
MeasurementID    | Identifier for each sample measurement that was recorded for each subject and activity performed.
MeanValue        | Calculated 'mean' value for each specific observation set per subject/activity/measurement.

## Tidy Dataset Class:
```{r}
class(tidyData)
```

## Tidy Dataset Structure
```{r}
str(tidyData)
```

## Tidy Dataset Head/Tail
```{r}
head(tidyData)
tail(tidyData)
```

## Tidy Dataset Summary
```{r}
summary(tidyData)
```

## Export Data
Data is exported to text file ""HumanActivityRecognitionUsingSmartphonesTidyDataset.txt" located in the current working directory of the script.

```{r save}
exportFname <- "HumanActivityRecognitionUsingSmartphonesTidyDataset.txt"
f <- file.path(dataFilePath, exportFname)
write.table(tidyData, f, quote=FALSE, row.names=FALSE)
```

## Script Execution Info
```{r}
message("StartTime: ", startTime, "\nEndTime: ", endTime, "\nRunTime: ", runTime)
```
