Human-Activity-Recognition-Using-Smartphones Project Codebook
=============================================================

This codebook was created on `r as.character(Sys.time())`.  It is auto-generated at the 
end of each execution run of the run_analysis.R script.


Tidy Dataset Variable Names
---------------------------

Variable Name    | Description
-----------------|------------
SubjectID        | Numeric identifier of each test subject responsible for performing each observation sample. 
ActivityID       | Descriptive name of each performed/sampled activity. 
MeasurementID    | Identifier for each sample measurement that was recorded for each subject and activity performed.
MeanValue        | Calculated 'mean' value for each specific observation set per subject/activity/measurement.

Tidy Data Attributes
--------------------

Structure:

```{r}
str(tidyData)
```

Class:

```{r}
class(tidyData)
```

Head/Tail
------------------------------

```{r}
head(tidyData)
tail(tidyData)
```

Summary
--------------------

```{r}
summary(tidyData)
```

Export Data
-----------
Data is exported to text file ""HumanActivityRecognitionUsingSmartphonesTidyDataset.txt" located in the current working directory of the script.


```{r save}
exportFname <- "HumanActivityRecognitionUsingSmartphonesTidyDataset.txt"
f <- file.path(dataFilePath, exportFname)
write.table(tidyData, f, quote=FALSE, row.names=FALSE)
```
